## Overview
The Bitcoin canister is the core component of the Bitcoin integration project. It enables other canisters deployed on the Internet Computer to use Bitcoin and interact with the Bitcoin network.

To this end, it provides a low-level API with a small set of functions, which serve as the foundation to build powerful Bitcoin libraries and other development tools, and Bitcoin smart contracts running on the Internet Computer.
