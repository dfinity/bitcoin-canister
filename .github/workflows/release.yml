#    - canister/CHANGELOG.md (date-based releases)
#    - watchdog/CHANGELOG.md (date-based releases)
#    - interface/CHANGELOG.md (semver releases)
#    - validation/CHANGELOG.md (semver releases)
# 2. Bumps versions in Cargo.toml files (semver crates only)
# 
# After merging the release PR, run the "Release & Publish" workflow (in publish.yml).
